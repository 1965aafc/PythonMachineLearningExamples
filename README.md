# PythonMachineLearingExamples

These are Python programs mostly taken from the book "Python Machine Learning"
by Sebastian Raschka

see the original programs from the book at:

These programs were intended to prove out the data set of character images found in
fonts.zip which will be automatically downloaded.

For a detailed explanation of each program, read "Python Machine Learning".

Due to the fact that a few E13B characters can be classified using only
two features, most of the example programs that use the Iris dataset can also be 
be used with E13B.

run_batch.sc is a bash script that runs all of the programs in the directory

The script file will create many files in the folder, ./plots.
